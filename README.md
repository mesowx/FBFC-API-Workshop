Hi! Thanks for [signing up] for our workshop and the 5th Fire Behavior and Fuels Conference! After this four hour tutorial, you'll be able to efficiently use the [MesoWest/SynopticLabs MesoNet Application Programming Interface] (API) to obtain millions of weather observations from over 43,000 observing stations across North America. Use this data to drive your applications, research, or student activities!

#### First things first:
You'll need to request an API key/token before making requests for our data. Please click **[here]** to access the sign up page. This process is immediate and shouldn't take longer than a few minutes. When you receive an email with your key, make sure to follow the instructions to generate a token. **Bring this key/token with you to the workshop!**

#### What to bring:
**Just a laptop!** Instruction will be provided via [IPython notebooks] hosted on this Github repository. Please come prepared with IPython installed on your computer (especially PC users).

#### Course Schedule:
Coming soon.
