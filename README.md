## Spring 2016 MesoWest/SynopticLabs API Workshop
#### University of Utah, Marriott Library, Room 1745, 10am to 12pm

Hi! Thanks for signing up for our workshop! After this two hour tutorial, you'll be able to efficiently use the [MesoWest/SynopticLabs MesoNet Application Programming Interface] (API) to obtain millions of weather observations from over 43,000 observing stations across North America. Use this data to drive your applications, research, or student activities.

#### First things first:
You'll need to request an API key/token before making requests for our data. Please click **[here]** to access the sign up page. This process is immediate and shouldn't take longer than a few minutes. When you receive an email with your key, make sure to follow the instructions to generate a token. **Bring this key/token with you to the workshop!**

#### What to bring:
**Just yourself!** Instruction will be provided via [IPython notebooks] hosted on this Github repository. Room 1745 is a Mac lab and iMacs will be provided for use. If you are strictly a PC user, please come prepared with IPython installed on your laptop. 

#### Course Schedule:
Check back soon!
