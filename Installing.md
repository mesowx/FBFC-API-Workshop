#Let's get things installed

We are just going to quickly go through how we expect you to install and use today's Python applications.

## For Windows

We are going to use the Anaconda suite for today's workshop, and we are going to use the Python3.5 version of that suite. If you have 2.7, that is great, but some of the functions we are going to use don't exist in Python 2.7. For windows, installing the 3.5 anaconda is as simple as:

1. Visit https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2. Download the Python 3.5 anaconda GUI installer
3. Open the installer, and install (just for you unless you are an admin), mostly just click next.

### To use this python

We talk a lot about notebooks, while we may call them ipython Notebooks, these work the same as the Jupyter notebooks that came installed with conda. Unless you are a console guru, we suggest you go to your applicatios list (start button, home screen, whichever) and under the Anaconda3 collection, you will see:

* Anaconda Navigator
* iPython
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda Prompt
* Spyder
* And some other things

Each of these will do awesome things for you, but for this exercise we are going to only be using the notebooks. Feel free to double click the Jupyter notebook application, and you will see your favorite web browser open up to a folder listing. 

## For Macs/Linux
