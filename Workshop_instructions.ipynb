    "- Python 3.4/3.5 \n",
    "- A web browser\n",
    "- The following python libraries: IPython, CartoPy, Bokeh, matplotlib and their dependencies. All other libraries should be built-in to your python installation\n",

    "The best way to satisfy the course requirements is to install the Anaconda package/environment manager at https://www.continuum.io/downloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you complete that download, open a command prompt and verify your anaconda installation by typing `conda info`. If the current version comes up, you're good to go. Now we can set up a clean working environment! Simply type `conda create -n apiworkshop anaconda` to create a new virtual environment that installs all of the common python libraries. Once that process is completed, activate this environment by typing `source activate apiworkshop`. Now, run `conda install -c scitools cartopy` and `conda install bokeh` to fulfill the course requirements. Lastly, navigate to your git clone of the workshop repo, and type `ipython notebook`. Your notebooks should be good to go!"
